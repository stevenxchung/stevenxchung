### 👋 Hi there, I'm Steven!

I'm the author of [**Goal-oriented Planning with Technology**](https://www.udemy.com/course/goal-oriented-framework/), a modern framework designed to help learners of all ages create and achieve meaningful goals by leveraging continuous learning and today’s tech tools. Over **2,400 students** have joined the course so far!

You might’ve found me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenxchung/) or by coming across my MOOC course notes. 📚 I’m also an alum of the [Georgia Tech OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) program, where I explored topics in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) and [Machine Learning](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained).
