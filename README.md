### Hi there, I'm Steven ðŸ‘‹.

Author of [Goal-oriented Planning with Technology](https://www.udemy.com/course/goal-oriented-framework/) which provides a novel and more modern goal-oriented framework that leverages continuous learning and modern technology tools to help audiences of all ages create and achieve their goals (currently ~2400+ students enrolled as of writing).

You may have stumbled across my profile from LinkedIn or after finding my MOOC course notes. Please note that many of my more extensive projects (e.g., digital wallet app, payments as a service, Web3 blockchain streaming service, etc.) are **private** and may be viewable only by appointment.

- ðŸ”­ I recently finished the MSCS program at [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) with focus on [AI](https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) and [Machine Learning](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and migrating some of my legacy JS projects to Next.js and Vercel
- ðŸ‘¯ I may be looking to collaborate on more AI and distributed systems projects in the future, particularly in the [FinTech](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp) space; DM if you need a super scrappy SWE ðŸ˜Ž
- ðŸ’¬ If you have any questions feel free to shoot me a message [via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenxchung/)
